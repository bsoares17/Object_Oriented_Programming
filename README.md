# Object_Oriented_Programming
/************ IT 3500 ****************************************************************
*************************************************************************************
**
** This program was prepared as part of the requirements for IT 3500,
** Object Oriented Programming.
**
** COURSE DESCRIPTION:
** This is the third course in a three-course programming sequence. This course
** introduces Object-Oriented (OO) Programming concepts in a programming language
** using a compatible integrated development environment. It includes the
** principles of OO Programming (OOP); encapsulation, polymorphism, reusable
** code, inheritance, composition, and abstraction.
**
** OOP also introduces graphical user interfaces and teaches the student how to
** properly create an OO graphical user interface.
**
** In addition, this course continues to develop basic problem analysis and
** critical thinking skills that aid the student when developing algorithms.
**
** Prerequisite: IT 2789, Structured Programming
**
** LEVEL:
** This course assumes the student understands the basics of programming and of
** writing code to implement the three basic programming constructs. If further
** assumes the student has the ability to analyze problems and can create
** program designs/algorithms from the problem analysis.
**
** COMPLETION CRITERIA:
** Upon successfully completing this course the student should be able to read a
** client description of a problem, analyze that problem, formulate an algorithm
** that will provide information that will support the client’s solving the
** problem, design and implement the algorithm, and produce the required
** information.
**
** COURSE LEARNING OUTCOMES:
** 1 Given an object to be represented in software, design, code and test a
** program that: defines a class to model the characteristics and behaviors
** of the object, defines appropriate constructors and destructors for the
** class, creates an instance of the object, and calls the methods of the
** object to solve a problem.
** 2 Given a class in a program; design, code, and test a program that controls
** the accessibility of the members of the class.
** 3 Given a set of specifications, design, code, and test a program that
** defines and uses a set of objects in which an instance of one object has a
** composition relationship with another.
** 4 Design, code, and test a program that defines and uses an array of objects.
** 5 Design, code, and test a program that defines and uses appropriate
** overloaded functions or operators.
** 6 Design, code, and test a program that employs inheritance and includes
** overriding.
** 7 Design, code, and test a program that contains statically and dynamically
** bound functions.
** 8 Given a set of objects related through inheritance; design, code, and test
** a program that utilizes an abstract base class.
** 9 Write a program that would generally be considered to be maintainable.
** 10 Given a problem where the resulting solution would be a large program,
** design, code, and test a modular solution using separate header,
** implementation files, and namespaces to manage complexity.

    ** ASSIGNMENT:
    ** English to Metric to English Converter
    **
    ** Your employer has asked you to write a program that will convert the English
    ** system of measurement into the metric system of measurement. The program must
    ** accept distances (in the English system) in miles, yards, feet, and inches and
    ** convert these distances into metric distances. The metric output will be
    ** kilometers, meters, and centimeters. Further, it must accept distances in
    ** kilometers, meters, and centimeters and convert these distances into English
    ** distances. The English output will be in miles, yards, feet, and inches.
    **
    ** Miles, yards, feet, kilometers, and meters will be whole numbers (no decimal point)
    ** while inches and centimeters will have one digit to the right of the decimal point.
    **
    ** 1 Describe the Requirements of this solution.
    ** 2 From the requirements, determine the features that must be implemented in the
    ** program.
    ** 3 Prepare a program design that adheres to the principles of clean code.
    ** 4 Include in that design a user-friendly image of the User Interface.
    ** 4 Implement that design in clean, maintainable, and extensible code.
    ** 5 Test your program.
    **
    ** Additional challenge (not required)
    ** A After your program is developed and tested, generate 100 random English inputs
    ** (that has 3 or fewer digits each for miles, yards, and feet and 4
    ** or fewer digits for inches) and convert them into Metric. Save the inputs and
    ** outputs in a file.
    ** B Use the outputs from part A to test the Metric to English conversion.
    **
    ** Limitations:
    ** • No libraries external to the language itself (i.e. nothing from the Internet)
    ** • Be sure to check for invalid or inappropriate inputs and handle them properly
    **
